CSC309 - Project Proposal
=========================

Application Description
-----------------------

Our web application will be a tutoring/mentoring service where students can sign
up and get help in different subject areas from tutors who have experience in
that specific subject area. Upon logging in, students will be able to search for
tutors based on a specific subject (or by name), and open a chat dialog with
them, send them private messages, or continue conversations from previous
messages. When students have received help with their work, they can rate the
experience they had with the particular tutor to provide feedback for future
students. Once tutors have enough ratings they will have the option of offering
a paid service to students to give them an incentive to provide the best
tutoring possible.
